# Project Overview

This project focus is on working with files, how to open, read, write and close them.
The use of JSON to convert python object to JSON format and vice versa is also tackled.
JSON data format is used because it is one of the data interchange format that makes it
easy for humans to read data from it and write into it, moreover it is also easier for
machines to parse it and also generate it. This is truly a win-win situation for both
parties.

Lessons given cut across the above mentioned things, and to understand the concepts better
a series of tasks have been provided to address all these aspects.

The tasks are as follows:
